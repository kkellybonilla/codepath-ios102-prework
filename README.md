### App Description

All students have to do is enter the respective information, and the app handles the introduction for them!

### App Walk-though

(☝️ Remove this paragraph after after adding gif). LICEcap is a great tool for recording and you can simply upload the gif to GitHub and provide the path name in place of URL as shown below.
